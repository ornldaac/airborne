The Hyperspectral Thermal Emissions Spectrometer (HyTES) instrument has 512 pixels across track with pixel sizes in the range of 5 to 50 m depending on aircraft flying height and 256 spectral channels between 7.5 and 12 micrometer. 

HyTES started science flights in 2012. Since then HyTES has flown on Twin Otter aircraft from Twin Otter International and the British Antarctic Survey, [NASA ER-2](https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/aircraft/ER-2_-_AFRC) and [NASA Gulfstream V](httphttps://airbornescience.nasa.gov/aircraft/Gulfstream_V_-_JSC).
