# MASTER

The MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator ([MASTER](https://masterprojects.jpl.nasa.gov/)) is a scanning spectrometer which flies on a variety of multi-altitude research aircraft and provides data similar to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ([MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/)) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ([ASTER](https://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/)). 

MASTER first flew in 1998 and has ongoing deployments as a Facility Instrument in the [NASA Airborne Science Program (ASP)](https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/).
